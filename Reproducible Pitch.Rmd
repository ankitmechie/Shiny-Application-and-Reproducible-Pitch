## Introduction
This assignment is for Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch. The data is taken from dataset mtcars. This model takes two values: No. of Cylinders and Weight of the car.

Input the value of no. of cylinders and weight of the car in below inputs to get the approximate range of Mileage of the car



## Data Source

We used the *mtcars* dataset, the documentation of which is available at the following link: https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html

## Data Labels
No. of Cyliners: whole nos.

Weight of the car:in 1000 lbs

Mileage of the car: in MPG


## Server Calculation
lower value= 37.29677-2.402365* cyl-4.769929*wt

mean value= 40.898313-1.784173* cyl-3.583425*wt

upper value= 44.49985-1.165981* cyl-2.396921*wt
